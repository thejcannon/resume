## Experience

### Team Lead - Build Engineer - IBM WatsonX Orders (previously McD Tech Labs)

- Supported the entire engineering org in all things Build Engineering
- Migrated our core build tooling from Bazel to Pants, resulting in:
  - **>10 Minutes** saved on local and PR runs of the static analysis and test pipeline
  - Over **twenty thousand** of lines of BUILD metadata collapsed into 800
  - A better developer experience
- Introduced several new static analysis tools to our toolkit to help catch issues early in the SDLC
- Pioneered the ability to dockerize any file with:
  - bit-wise reproduction capabilities
  - maximum leveraging of the docker layer cache, yielding fast re-builds
  - automatic dependency upgrades
- Resident "Pythonista" offering support and solutions to all engineers for our entire codebase

Overall, removed hurdles and blockages that were interrupting an engineer's ability to focus on
writing production-ready application code, while still increasing code quality and security.

### Senior Software Engineer - National Instruments

- Led company-wide Python coding conventions and best practices group with am emphasis on automated
  tooling
- Aided the design and implementation of a new company-wide CI/CD pipeline with a focus on
  flexibility, performance, and ease-of-use
- Designed and implemented foundational C++ device API engine to replace outdated C-based
  implementation which resulted in better testing support, cleaner code, and in some cases 4x speed
  improvement
- Created/Maintained backport library of subset of "modern" C++ STL to be used with older compilers

## Technical

Pantsbuild

      - Making commands run as quickly as possible
      - Upstreaming all of my internal plugins, so the community benefits
    - Provided Slack and GitHub support for the entire Pants community

Programming Languages
